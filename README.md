# Telegram to X (Twitter) Video Poster

Automatically fetch the oldest unprocessed videos from Telegram groups/channels and post them to your X (Twitter) account with captions.

## Features

- üé• Fetches oldest unprocessed videos from Telegram groups/channels
- üìù Intelligently extracts captions from video messages or surrounding messages
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloads videos with progress tracking
- üê¶ Uploads videos to X (Twitter) with captions
- üíæ Persistent session management (no repeated logins)
- üìä Tracks processed videos to avoid duplicates
- üßπ Automatic cleanup of downloaded files
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable file size limits and download directory

## Prerequisites

1. **Telegram API Credentials**

   - Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
   - Create an application to get `api_id` and `api_hash`

2. **X (Twitter) API Credentials**

   - Go to [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com)
   - Create an app to get API keys and access tokens
   - You need: API Key, API Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret

3. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create your environment file:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit `.env` with your credentials:

   ```env
   # Telegram API credentials
   TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id_here
   TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash_here

   # Twitter/X API credentials
   TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret_here

   # Telegram group/channel to fetch videos from
   TELEGRAM_GROUP=@your_group_or_channel_name

   # Optional settings
   DOWNLOAD_DIR=./downloads
   MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB=50
   ```

## Usage

### First Run

On your first run, you'll need to authenticate with Telegram:

```bash
npm start
```

The script will prompt you for:

- Your phone number (with country code, e.g., +1234567890)
- Verification code sent to your phone
- 2FA password (if enabled)

Your session will be saved for future runs.

### Daily Automation

Set up a cron job to run the script daily:

```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/your/project && npm start
```

Or use a scheduler like PM2:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

## How It Works

### Video Fetching Logic

The script uses an **efficient pagination system** to handle large groups:

1. **Smart Batching**: Processes videos in small batches (50 at a time) instead of loading thousands
2. **Offset Tracking**: Remembers where it left off using `video_offset.json`
3. **Reverse Order**: Starts from the oldest messages (`reverse: true`)
4. **Automatic Progression**: When a batch is fully processed, automatically moves to the next batch
5. **Memory Efficient**: Never loads more than 50 videos into memory at once

**Example for 9000 videos:**

- Day 1: Processes videos 1-50 (finds oldest unprocessed)
- Day 2: Continues from video 51-100
- Day 3: Continues from video 101-150
- And so on...

### Caption Extraction Logic

The script intelligently extracts captions using multiple strategies:

1. **Direct Caption**: First checks if the video message itself contains text
2. **Previous Message**: If no direct caption, checks the message sent before the video
3. **Next Message**: If still no caption, checks the message sent after the video
4. **Smart Filtering**: Only considers surrounding messages if:
   - They're from the same sender
   - They're sent within 5 minutes of the video
   - They contain actual text content

This approach handles various posting patterns:

- Videos with captions sent together
- Caption sent before uploading the video
- Caption sent as a follow-up after the video

### File Management

- Downloads videos to `./downloads/` (configurable)
- Uses timestamps and message IDs for unique filenames
- Automatically cleans up downloaded files after posting
- Respects file size limits (default 50MB)

## Configuration Options

| Variable            | Description                       | Default       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `TELEGRAM_GROUP`    | Group/channel username or ID      | Required      |
| `DOWNLOAD_DIR`      | Directory for temporary downloads | `./downloads` |
| `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB` | Maximum video file size in MB     | `50`          |

## Files Created

- `telegram_session.txt` - Stores your Telegram session (keep secure!)
- `processed_videos.json` - Tracks which videos have been posted
- `video_offset.json` - Tracks current position in the video list for pagination
- `downloads/` - Temporary directory for video files (auto-cleaned)

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limits
- File I/O errors
- Authentication problems
- Video size limits
- Missing captions

## Security Notes

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- The `telegram_session.txt` file contains sensitive session data
- Consider using environment variables in production instead of `.env` files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No videos found"**

   - Check that the group/channel name is correct
   - Ensure the bot has access to the group
   - Verify there are actually video messages in the group

2. **"Authentication failed"**

   - Double-check your API credentials
   - Ensure your phone number includes the country code
   - Try deleting `telegram_session.txt` and re-authenticating

3. **"Video too large"**

   - Increase `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB` in your `.env` file
   - Or skip large videos by keeping the default limit

4. **Twitter upload fails**
   - Verify your Twitter API credentials have write permissions
   - Check that your app has the necessary permissions
   - Ensure the video format is supported (MP4 works best)
